# Atlantis

This is a research project to rewrite a cross platform GameBoy Advance Emulator in Rust.

## Getting Started

Ensure SDL2 is installed or available as a dependency.

### Windows

Grab the SDL2 binaries available [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php). Include the appropriate dlls such as (*SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer*) in the same folder as `Atlantis`.

### MacOS

Install SDL2 using homebrew:

```bash
> brew install SDL2
> brew install SDL2_image
> brew install SDL2_mixer
```
